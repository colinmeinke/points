# Points

A specification for storing shape data in Javascript. Includes
[functions](#functions) for adding, removing, reordering,
converting and manipulating points.

**4.0kb gzipped. No dependencies.**

## Example shape

```js
const shape = [
  { x: 50, y: 30, moveTo: true },
  { x: 50, y: 70, curve: { type: 'arc', rx: 20, ry: 20, sweepFlag: 1 } },
  { x: 50, y: 30, curve: { type: 'arc', rx: 20, ry: 20, sweepFlag: 1 } }
]
```

## Functions

- [`add()`](#add) – add additional points to a shape
- [`boundingBox()`](#boundingBox) – get a shape's bounding box and
  center coordinates
- [`cubify()`](#cubify) – convert shape's curves to cubic beziers
- [`length()`](#length) – get a shape's length
- [`moveIndex()`](#moveIndex) – change the starting point of a shape
- [`offset()`](#offset) – offset a shape
- [`position()`](#position) – find the coordinates and angle at a
  specific point of a shape
- [`remove()`](#remove) – remove unrequired points of a shape
- [`reverse()`](#reverse) – reverse the order of points of a shape
- [`rotate()`](#rotate) – rotate a shape
- [`scale()`](#scale) – scale a shape

## Specification

A shape is an array of 2 or more point objects.

A line should be drawn between each point in a shape.

Adding a `moveTo` property to a point indicates that
a line should *not* be drawn to that point from the
previous.

The first point in a shape must include the `moveTo`
property.

### Point types

Each point is somewhere on an `x`, `y` plane. Therefore, at
the very least each point object requires `x` and `y`
properties. Values should be numeric.

#### Basic

```js
{ x: 10, y: 25 }
```

#### Arc

```js
{
  x: 80,
  y: 35,
  curve: {
    type: 'arc',
    rx: 2,
    ry: 2,
    xAxisRotation: 45,
    sweepFlag: 1,
    largeArcFlag: 1
  }
}
```

The curve properties `xAxisRotation`, `sweepFlag` and
`largeArcFlag` are all optional and if missing are assumed to
be `0`.

#### Quadratic bezier

```js
{
  x: 100,
  y: 200,
  curve: {
    type: 'quadratic',
    x1: 50,
    y1: 200
  }
}
```

#### Cubic bezier

```js
{
  x: 5,
  y: 10,
  curve: {
    type: 'cubic',
    x1: 2,
    y1: 0,
    x2: 3,
    y2: 10
  }
}
```

## Installation

```
npm install points
```

## Function usage

### add

```js
import { add } from 'points'
const newShape = add(shape, 25)
```

Takes an existing shape array as the first argument, and the
total number of desired points as the second argument. Adds
points without changing the shape and returns a new shape
array.

### boundingBox

```js
import { boundingBox } from 'points'
const { top, right, bottom, left, center } = boundingBox(shape)
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape arrays,
as the only argument and returns an object of bounding
coordinates including a `center` property containing the
`x`, `y` values.

### cubify

```js
import { cubify } from 'points'
const newShape = cubify(shape)
```

Takes an existing shape array as the only argument, or an
array of shape arrays, and converts any arc or quadratic
bezier points to cubic bezier points.

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

### length

```js
import { length } from 'points'
const value = length(shape, 1)
```

Takes an existing shape array as the first argument. The
optional second argument takes a number above 0 but below
180. This second argument is the accuracy (in degrees) used
to calculate when a curve is *straight enough* to be
considered a straight line. Returns the length of the shape.

### moveIndex

```js
import { moveIndex } from 'points';
const newShape = moveIndex(shape, 3);
```

Takes an existing shape array as the first argument, and the
desired number of points to shift the index as the second
argument (this can be a negative integer too). Returns a new
shape array.

### offset

```js
import { offset } from 'points'
const newShape = offset(shape, 10, 20)
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape arrays,
as the first argument, the horizontal offset as the second
argument, and the vertical offset as the third argument.

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

### position

```js
import { position } from 'points'
const { angle, x, y } = position(shape, 0.5, 1)
```

Takes an existing shape array as the first argument, and
an interval (a number from 0 to 1) as the second argument.
The optional third argument takes a number above 0 but below
180. This third argument is the accuracy (in degrees) used
to calculate when a curve is *straight enough* to be
considered a straight line. Returns an object that includes
the `x` and `y` coordinates at the interval of the shape,
and the `angle` of that point with the vertical.

### remove

```js
import { remove } from 'points'
const newShape = remove(shape)
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape
arrays, as the only argument, and removes any points that
do not affect the shape.

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

### reverse

```js
import { reverse } from 'points'
const newShape = reverse(shape)
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape
arrays, as the only argument, and reverses the order of
the points.

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

### rotate

```js
import { rotate } from 'points'
const newShape = rotate(shape, 45)
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape arrays,
as the first argument. Takes the clockwise angle of rotation
as the second argument.

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

### scale

```js
import { scale } from 'points'
const newShape = scale(shape, 0.5, 'topLeft')
```

Takes an existing shape array, or an array of shape arrays,
as the first argument. Takes the scale factor as the second
argument and an anchor point as the third argument.

The anchor point can take any of the following strings:

- center (default)
- topLeft
- topRight
- bottomRight
- bottomLeft

Returns a new shape array or an array of shape arrays,
depending on input.

## CommonJS

This is how you get to the good stuff if you're using
`require`.

```js
const Points = require('points')
const add = Points.add
const boundingBox = Points.boundingBox
const cubify = Points.cubify
const moveIndex = Points.moveIndex
const offset = Points.offset
const position = Points.position
const remove = Points.remove
const reverse = Points.reverse
const scale = Points.scale
```

## UMD

And if you just want to smash in a Javascript file you're
also covered. Drop this in place ...

[https://unpkg.com/points/dist/points.min.js](https://unpkg.com/points/dist/points.min.js)

Then access it on the `Points` global variable.

```js
const add = Points.add
const boundingBox = Points.boundingBox
const cubify = Points.cubify
const moveIndex = Points.moveIndex
const offset = Points.offset
const position = Points.position
const remove = Points.remove
const reverse = Points.reverse
const scale = Points.scale
```
